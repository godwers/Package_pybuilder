## The Python Packager automaker!!!
This is a simple python package auto-generator that I made because I was bored.

Based on [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/)

The file structure looks like this:
- project_name
   - project_name/  
     - \_\_init_\_\.py
     - main.py
   - tests/
     - testing go here idk
   - LICENSE
   - README.md
   - setup.py
   - pyproject.toml
