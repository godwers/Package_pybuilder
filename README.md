## The Python Packager automaker!!!
This is a simple python package auto-generator that I made because I was bored.

Based on [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/)

The file structure looks like this:
- project_name
   - build/
   - dist/
   - project_name/  
     - \_\_init_\_\.py
     - main.py
   - project_name.egg-info
   - tests/
   - venv/
   - .gitignore
   - LICENSE
   - README.md
   - pyproject.toml

# How to use:
Download it or create a alias of the command below and use it on the terminal:

``source <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godwers/Package_pybuilder/refs/heads/master/package_build.sh)``

# Dependencies:
- git
- pip
